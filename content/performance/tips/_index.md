## There are a few to try when targeting optimization

#### Hooks `useCallback` and `useMemo`

#### `react-virtualized` & `react-window`

#### React `PureComponent`

#### Reselect for redux computation

#### Web Workers

#### React.memo()

#### Lazy loading `React.lazy()`

#### Smarter `shouldComponentUpdate` implementation
